# Dependencies

ofxFFmpegRecorder depends only on openFrameworks and nothing else.


# Looking for Maintainers

I have not been active in openFrameworks and I still see some activity around this library. In order to not leave those who create issues and PRs hanging, it'd be great if one of the fork holders can take up the maintanence of the library. If you are interested, please send an email or open an issue. If you have an active fork, and would like to continue that, please let me know so I can link to it from here so it becomes more visible.
